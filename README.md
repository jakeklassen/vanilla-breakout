# Udemy Breakout Course

This repo holds the final result planned for an Udemy course.

## Goals

Keep it simple.

No major/obtuse abstractions, repeating code is fine, single JS file. This is meant to be a _conversation_ starter, get your feet wet and improve upon.

Use [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/) as a _level editor_. Process bitmap data to _levels_.

## Prerequisites

- Basic HTML/CSS
- Comfortable with JavaScript

## How to Run

```shell
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```
